<br><br>
Back then, his dream was to become a soldier, doctor, nurse, flight attendant, model, artist, and businessman.  However, he eventually ended up in an Information Technology course, which he had never expected to do.
<br><br>
Java was the first language he learned because it was introduced to them at the University of Batangas while they were still in SHS. Furthermore, they were taught HTML, PHP, CSS, Python, and other languages.</p>
